        This specification defines a timing object and an associated API to implement an ideal clock that advances deterministically in accordance with a local or online system clock and that may be used for reliable distributed synchronization.

      <p>
        The specification is intended for discussion within the Multi-Device Timing Community Group. Its content does not yet represent the consensus of the Community Group.

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification aims to make it possible and easy to synchronize playback of media (and non-media) content across Web clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, the specification introduces a timing object that is essentially an ideal clock, advancing deterministically in accordance with a system clock. In this context, <em>ideal</em> means that it should take exactly 2.0 seconds for the <code>currentTime</code> property of the timing object to advance from 3.0 to 5.0 when its <code>playbackRate</code> is 1.0. The deterministic behavior is required for reliable distributed synchronization.
      </p>
      <p>
        A timing object may be associated with an online timing resource that represents various application-level timing concepts, such as clocks, timeouts, stop-watches or media controllers. Timing resources are true objects on the Web, identified by URLs and hosted by timing services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the timing object is associated with an online timing resources, the timing object acts as a proxy object, mediating access to the online timing resource. This way, control operations such as <em>play</em> or <em>pause</em> are forwarded to the timing service. Effects can then be propagated equally to all connected clients. The timing object fully encapsulates the complexity of multi-device operation and leaves the programmer to interact only with local objects.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="overview.png" width="400" alt="The image illustrates the concept of an online timing resource and used to synchronize content across three different Web clients through timing elements" />
        <figcaption>Multi-device synchronization architecture</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <a href="#fig-multi-device-synchronization-architecture"></a> illustrates three Web clients hosted by three different devices, say a laptop, a smartphone and a tablet. These three Web clients each have a timing object connected to a single, online, multi-device timing resource. For example, the online timing resource could be used as basis for shared media control, allowing multiple clients to operate in synchrony. This way, a laptop could present a video, the smartphone could present the audio track, and the tablet could present controls, progressbar, and timed extra information. If the timing resource is requested to pause, all connected clients pause in unison.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        The protocol used to connect, synchronize and interact with online timing resources will be defined in a separate specification.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Similarly, the integration of the timing object with HTML5 Media Elements [[HTML5]] is out of scope of this specification.

        Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and terminate these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("must", "should", "may", etc.) used in introducing the algorithm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant).

      <h2>Timing objects</h2>

      <p>A <dfn>timing object</dfn> represents an ideal clock that advances deterministically in accordance with a local or online system clock.</p>

      <p>
        A <a>timing object</a> has an <dfn>internal motion</dfn> represented by a <a>media state vector</a>, which must initially be set to <code>(p<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>0</sub>)</code> where <code>p<sub>0</sub>=0.0</code>, <code>v<sub>0</sub>=0.0</code>, <code>a<sub>0</sub>=0.0</code> and where <code>t<sub>0</sub></code> is the local timestamp when the object is created.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a>timing object</a> maintains an <dfn>internal synchronization state</dfn> that contains an estimate of the current client's clock skew relative to the online timing service when the object is associated with an <a>online timing resource</a>, as well as an estimate of the current network latency between the client and the online timing service. This information is used to correct timestamp values when <a title="media state vector">media state vectors</a> are exchanged between the client and the timing service. The user agent must initialize the skew and latency to 0.0. If the <a>timing object</a> is not associated with an online timing service, the skew and latency remain at 0.0.
      </p>

      <p><a title="timing object">Timing objects</a> implement the following interface:</p>

        <dt>void update (optional double? position, optional double? velocity, optional double? acceleration, optional Object? options)</dt>
        <dd>
          When called, the user agent must <a>update the internal motion</a> to the provided parameters, at the time when the update operation is processed. The parameters for the update operation are optional, i.e., null values may be supplied. This provides a simple mechanism for tying movements together. The idea is to allow one aspect of the movement to be updated while preserving the others. For instance, <code>update(null, value, null)</code> means "update velocity while preserving position and acceleration". Note that the values we want to preserve are not from the internal state, but rather from a snapshot of the <a>MediaStateVector</a> that represents the <a>internal motion</a>, taken at exactly the time when the update is processed.

            <dd>The new acceleration, or null to preserve the current value at the time the update is processed.</dd>

        <dd>When invoked, the user agent must invoke the <code>update</code> method of the <a>Timing</a> object with parameters <code>(null, 0.0, null)</code>. The update effectively causes the motion to stop.</dd>

        <dd>When invoked, the user agent must invoke the <code>update</code> method of the <a>Timing</a> object with parameters <code>(null, 1.0, null)</code>. The update effectively causes the motion to play at the usual playback rate.</dd>
